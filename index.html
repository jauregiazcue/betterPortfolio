				<h1>Gameplay and Tools Programmer</h1>
				<p>Game developer looking forward to specialize in artificial
					intelligence and gameplay programming. Since the first console my family gave me when
					I was a child, I was always thinking “how in the world are these videogames created ?”.</p>
				<p>Due to my desire for knowledge, at 13 I started taking courses
					to learn how to create videogames using different engines.</p>
				<p>From that point onward I never stopped, that is why I went
					to ESAT to study how to properly program, I am in Sheffield Hallam University to improve
					my skills and I am eager to learn from industry workers and improve even more.</p>
